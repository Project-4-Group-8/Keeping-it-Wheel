## Overview
Buying a car for the first time can be a stressful experience, especially if youâ€™re a recent college graduate. We have a client who has just graduated college and is looking for a new car to commute to his new job. We have been hired to predict car prices to help our client make the best economical decision on his car purchase. We will be performing Unsupervised ML to our Datasets. We will fit the model, train and predict the model using unsupervised algorithms. We will be using Jupyter notebook, python, pandas for cleaning and SQL database as our data retrieval source in our ETL process.
